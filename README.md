# Monty-Hall-Problem
Welcome to the Monty Hall Problem simulation by Profannyti! This Python script recreates the classic probability puzzle known as the Monty Hall Problem. In this game, there are three doors behind which there are two ducks and a luxurious car. The player makes an initial choice, and then one of the doors with a duck is revealed. The player is then given the option to either stick with their initial choice or switch to the remaining unopened door. The script will display the final result based on the player's decision.

## How to Run the Simulation:
### 1. Clone the Repository:
Clone the repository containing the Python script to your local machine.
```
git clone <repository_url> 
```
### 2. Navigate to the Script:
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
```
cd <path_to_script_directory>
```
### 3. Run the Script:
Execute the script using the Python interpreter.
```
python monty_hall_simulation.py
```
### 4. Follow On-screen Instructions:
The script will prompt you to choose a door (A, B, C) initially. After your choice, it will reveal a door with a duck that wasn't your initial choice. Then, you will be asked if you want to switch doors or stick with your original choice. Make your decision by typing 'keep' or 'switch' accordingly.

### 5. View the Final Result:
The script will display the final outcome based on your decision, revealing whether you won the luxurious car or ended up with a duck.

## Understanding the Code:
- The script uses ASCII art to visually represent the doors and their contents.
- Rewards (ducks and a car) are randomly assigned to the doors.
- The player's initial choice is taken as input, and a door with a duck that wasn't the initial choice is opened.
- The player is then given the option to switch or keep their original choice.
- The final result is displayed based on the player's decision.
- Feel free to experiment with the Monty Hall Problem and test whether your intuition aligns with the probability theory!
